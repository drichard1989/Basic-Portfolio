<!-- This 'header bar' is meant to be a position fixed bar that stays at the top of the page with my name, and links for navigation next to it using semantic elements. I am trying to use semantic elements as much as possible.  -->

			<h1>About Me</h1>
				
				<!-- This is where my headshot is going to go. -->
				<img src="#">
				
				<!-- These are where the paragraphs for my bio are placed. -->
				<p>I was born in Willis, TX, and attended Willis Schools for most of my primary education. I then attended the University of Texas at Tyler, and received a degree in Marketing, along with a minor in Management. While in college, I participated in multiple internships, and received Marketing Student of the Year my senior year. </p>

				<p>Through my experiences, I have come to understand the importance of empowering employees, developing win-win relationships with coworkers, and being able to manage top talent while taking ego out of the equation. In reference to one of my favorite entrepreneurs, Steve Jobs, "The best ideas have to win, otherwise good people don't stay." I carry this belief over to my work every day, and continue to brainstorm cutting edge ideas for future development. </p>

				<p>I have managed business development, helped develop powerful media marketing plans while utilizing social media platforms, and have provided a creative marketing environment with the help of collaboration with incredible co-workers. I also have extensive experience in technology training, and love the idea of empowering the minds of many with the technology that is shaping the world today.</p>

				<p>Today, I am working through a coding program to become a Full Stack Developer, utilizing my critical thinking skills developed though years of experience in the work force, and from graduating from UT Tyler. </p>
